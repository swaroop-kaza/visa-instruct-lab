            "answer": "Criminals target merchants in the digital age because they are where the money is, just like Willie Sutton robbed banks in the 20th century. Merchants are a key part of payment card transactions and processing systems, making them a prime target for financial fraud. Occasionally, lax security by some merchants enables criminals to easily steal and use personal consumer financial information from payment card transactions and processing systems, which is a serious problem. Compliance with the PCI DSS helps to alleviate these vulnerabilities and protect cardholder data."
