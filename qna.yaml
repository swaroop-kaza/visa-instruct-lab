          and security parameters not be used?'

        answer: 'Vendor-supplied defaults should not be
            used because they pose a security risk and
            can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.'

      There are three ongoing steps for adhering to the PCI DSS: Assess
        identifying all locations of cardholder data,
        taking an inventory of your IT assets and business
        processes for payment card processing and analyzing
        them for vulnerabilities that could expose cardholder data.
        Repair — fixing identified vulnerabilities,
        securely removing any unnecessary cardholder data storage,
        and implementing secure business processes.
        Report — documenting assessment and remediation details,

      The PCI DSS applies to any organization that handles,
      stores, or transmits cardholder data, regardless of the volume of
      transactions. It consists of 12 requirements, which are
      categorized into six major areas:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     │
      1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network**:
      Implement firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus
      software to protect the network against unauthorized access.
      2. **Protect Cardholder Data**: Encrypt data both
      at rest and in transit, restrict access to cardholder data,
      and secure physical premises.
      3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**:
      Regularly scan networks and systems for vulnerabilities,
      patch security flaws, and maintain a vulnerability management policy.
      4. **Implement Strong Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder
      data on a need-to-know basis, use strong passwords
      and multi-factor authentication, and regularly monitor and review │
      access controls.                                                                                                                                                                           │
      5. ** regularly Monitor and Test Networks**: Perform
      regular security monitoring, vulnerability scanning,
      and penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
      6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**: Develop and
      implement a comprehensive information security policy,
      regularly review and update it, and provide training to all employees.                                                                                                                                                                                           │
      Compliance with the PCI DSS is mandatory for any organization
      that handles cardholder data. Failure to comply can result in fines,
      legal action, and damage to the organization's
